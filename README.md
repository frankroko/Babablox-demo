```

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: Node.js 18+ recommended.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Image Optimization

Optimize images into WebP files under `public/assets-optimized`:

```bash
npm run optimize:images
```

Notes:
- The app currently references images from `public/assets-optimized`.
- If you add new images to `public/assets`, run the optimizer again.

## Key Behavior

- Auth, cart, and order history are stored in `localStorage`.
- Orders route (`/orders`) requires login.
- The mobile navbar uses a burger menu with an animated close state.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: start Vite dev server
- `npm run build`: production build
- `npm run preview`: preview production build
- `npm run optimize:images`: generate optimized WebP assets
